#### k-nearest neighbors

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.

The KNN Classification Algorithm is a machine learning algorithm used to classify data. It works by finding a group of similar data points and then classifying them as belonging to the same group.

In this excercise, we'll be using the KNN classification algorithm to cluster like-groups automatically. We'll fit artificial data with KNN, and then use Elbow method, test-train-split, optimizing K-values to train our model.
